# 🏥 Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction

This machine learning project analyzes patient data from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil to predict whether a patient is likely to miss their appointment ("no-show").

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis with clear visualizations
- ⚙️ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🧠 Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- 🧪 Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- 📉 Addressing class imbalance with resampling techniques
- 📍 Visual results included (feature importance, classification report)
  
## 📂 Dataset
Public dataset from Kaggle: [Medical Appointment No Show](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

## 📄 Outputs
All results and evaluation metrics are available in the `results/` folder.

## 📌 Skills Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning (Classification), Data Preprocessing, Data Imbalance Handling.
